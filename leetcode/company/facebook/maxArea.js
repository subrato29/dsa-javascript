Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16

Example 4:
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2

        let min = Math.min (height[i], height[j]);
        max = Math.max (max, min * (j - i));

            i++;
        } else {
            j--;
