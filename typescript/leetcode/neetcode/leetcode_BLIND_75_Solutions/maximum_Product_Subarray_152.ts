/**
 * 152. Maximum Product Subarray
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.
 *
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
 */

/**
 * Initialization: We initialize maxProduct, minProduct, and result with the first element of the array. These variables represent the maximum product subarray, the minimum product subarray, and the final result, respectively.
 *
 * Iteration: We iterate through the array starting from the second element.
 *
 * Swap for Negatives: If the current element is negative, we swap maxProduct and minProduct because multiplying by a negative number flips the maximum and minimum.
 *
 * Update maxProduct and minProduct: We update maxProduct and minProduct by comparing the current element and the product of the current element with the previous maxProduct and minProduct.
 *
 * Update Result: We update the result with the maximum value of maxProduct.
 *
 * This approach ensures that we always keep track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current element, leading to a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of 𝑂(1)
