/**
 * A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its 
 * surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an 
 * outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time 
 * a function is created, at function creation time.

/**
 * A closure makes sure that a function does not loose connection to variables that existed at the
 * function's birthplace. A closure is an internal property of a function.

/**
 * A closure has higher priority over scope chain
